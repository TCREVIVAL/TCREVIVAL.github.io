    <h1>TCR Token Whitepaper</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>TCR is a deflationary utility token designed to support the restoration and stabilization of the USTC peg. By implementing a strategic buyback-and-lock mechanism, TCR facilitates the progressive reduction of USTC supply and incentivizes long-term holders of both tokens.</p>

    <h2>Token Details</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Token Name:</strong> Terra Classic Revival (TCR)</li>
      <li><strong>Total Supply:</strong> 10,000,000 TCR (Hard Cap)</li>
      <li><strong>Token Nature:</strong> Deflationary</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>TCR serves as a utility and reserve token to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Support the re-pegging of USTC to $1.</li>
      <li>Accumulate lock and burn USTC from the market.</li>
      <li>Burn TCR based on USTC price milestones.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>USTC Buyback and Lock Mechanism</h2>
    <p>All USTC acquired via taxes only is locked/burned in the TCR Reward Pool. USTC will remain locked until specific price levels are met.</p>

    <h2>Implementation of the Tax System</h2>
    <p>Tax on TCR is 0.5%. This tax will be split into three parts at the end of every month:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>40% goes to buy USTC.</li>
      <li>30% goes to TCR liquidity pool provision.</li>
      <li>30% goes to buy back TCR from the market.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This system creates long-term value for TCR holders and provides solid returns to those who buy and HOLD the token, in addition to the expected 8% return.</p>

    <h2>Unlock and TCR Burn Triggers</h2>
    <p>Once USTC reaches a new milestone price (in $0.05 increments), 10% of the total locked USTC is used to buy back and burn TCR tokens from the market.</p>
    <p><strong>Trigger Table:</strong> USTC Price Milestones and TCR Burns</p>
    <p>Continue buyback and burn</p>

    <h2>Understanding the Trigger Table</h2>
    <p>The Trigger Table adds value back to TCR and can perform massive USTC burns.</p>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <p><strong>Q:</strong> What would happen with the accumulated USTC under the Unlock and TCR Burn?</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> When the price of USTC touches the price mentioned in the table, two transactions will happen:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>10% of USTC will be used to buy back TCR.</li>
      <li>The remaining 90% of USTC will be burned forever and sent to anxu.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>TCR Games and Utility</h2>
    <p>Apart from this great feature, our team is working to create:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Games</li>
      <li>Small utilities</li>
      <li>Initiatives to bring legacy businesses to the LUNC blockchain</li>
      <li>Social media campaigns to invite new users to explore LUNC and its Layer 2 projects</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This will further accelerate the use case and value generation for TCR and its token holders.</p>

    <h2>Long to Medium Term Wealth Generation</h2>
    <p>We strongly believe this token can create long-term wealth generation with the support of the community. Please note, it does not involve complex solutions for repeg and does not need any investments. People can buy as per the capacity they have and get rewards based on the amount they invest. The more you trade and hold, the better it gets for USTC and the token holders.</p>

    <h2>USTC Supply Target</h2>
    <p>TCR is designed to continuously acquire USTC via transaction taxes and lock it until milestone triggers are met. The goal is to reduce the circulating supply of USTC down to 1 billion tokens, supporting a gradual return to peg and restoring ecosystem stability.</p>

    <h2>Strengths of the TCR Approach</h2>
    <ul>
      <li class="check">✅ Deflationary Model – The buyback-and-lock mechanism progressively reduces USTC supply, which is a crucial step for increasing scarcity and supporting price appreciation.</li>
      <li class="check">✅ Tax Mechanism – A well-designed 0.5% tax ensures continuous acquisition of USTC and strengthens liquidity provisions.</li>
      <li class="check">✅ Incentives for Holding – Encouraging long-term holding and staking of TCR helps mitigate market volatility.</li>
      <li class="check">✅ USTC Burn Triggers – The milestone-based burning strategy systematically reduces excess USTC in circulation.</li>
      <li class="check">✅ Decentralized Growth – Plans for games, utilities, and business adoption add real-world value beyond just being a trading asset.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Challenges & Considerations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li class="warn">⚠️ Market Participation is Critical – The success depends on enough people trading, staking, and holding both TCR and USTC. If adoption is slow, the impact will be limited.</li>
      <li class="warn">⚠️ Liquidity & Exchange Support – TCR is listed on GDEX and getting traded on Vyntrex.io. Our aim is to get listed on Terraport, Terraswap and all the other major LUNC Exchanges. Once that is accomplished, we want to get listed across platforms. This would require community to come together and support us.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The key success factor will be real-world adoption – if TCR's utilities (games, business adoption, and staking rewards) attract users, it could significantly strengthen the USTC peg over time.</p>
