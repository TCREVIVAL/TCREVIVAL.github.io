    <h1><span class="icon">🧠</span>How to Create Long-Term Wealth Using TCR Token</h1>

    <h2><span class="icon">💸</span>Earn Money While Burning USTC</h2>
    <p>If you've gone through our TCR Token omics, you already understand how the carefully structured supply mechanics ensure scarcity, demand, and controlled circulation. But that's just one part of the picture.</p>
    <p>Now, let's show you how we're turning the TCR ecosystem into a powerful wealth-building machine - powered by our innovative Smart Loop™ Protocol.</p>

    <h2><span class="icon">🔁</span>Introducing Smart Loop™ - TCR's Wealth Engine</h2>
    <p>The Smart Loop™ Protocol is an automated feedback mechanism designed by the TCR Team to reward long-term holders, reduce supply, and increase market strength over time.</p>
    <p>At its core, the Smart Loop™ works through two core wallets:</p>

    <h3><span class="icon">🧳</span>1. TCR Admin Wallet</h3>
    <p>This wallet has received 35 million LUNC so far - fully funded by our NFT and token investors. That's right - all transparent and verifiable on-chain. Check it out yourself if you don't believe us!</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Buybacks of TCR tokens</li>
      <li>Liquidity injections</li>
      <li>Strategic investments in Terra Classic projects</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><span class="icon">🏦</span>2. TCR Tax Wallet</h3>
    <p>Starting April 9th, 2025, every TCR transaction is taxed at just 0.5%. This might sound small - but here's how that tiny amount creates serious long-term value:</p>
    <p>All collected tax is staked across high-performing LUNC Layer 2 projects, generating real APR returns, which feed back into the ecosystem.</p>

    <h2><span class="icon">💰</span>Smart Loop™ Tax Distribution (Monthly)</h2>
    <p>Every month, the tax revenue is split 3 ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong><span class="icon">📈</span>40% - USTC Buybacks:</strong> Adds backing power to our token economy and brings liquidity options closer to parity through multi-layered buybacks.</li>
      <li><strong><span class="icon">💧</span>30% - Liquidity Pool Provision:</strong> Strengthens liquidity pools, ensuring smoother trades and price stability.</li>
      <li><strong><span class="icon">🔄</span>30% - Market Buybacks of TCR:</strong> Reduces supply, adds upward price pressure, and rewards holders.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><span class="icon">🚀</span>Why This Works Long Term</h2>
    <p>This setup isn't just theory. It's a self-sustaining cycle. As the community grows and more transactions happen:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>More tax is collected</li>
      <li>More LUNC is staked</li>
      <li>More rewards are harvested</li>
      <li>More TCR is bought and burned</li>
      <li>Circulating supply drops</li>
      <li>Price strengthens</li>
      <li>More users join</li>
      <li>Repeat 🔁</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It's decentralized, automated, and tied directly to on-chain activity – not hype.</p>

    <h2><span class="icon">📢</span>Next Presale: After $0.02 Milestone</h2>
    <p>We're not stopping here. The next presale will go live once TCR hits the $0.02 mark – an event controlled and triggered automatically by the Smart Loop™ Protocol.</p>
    <p>That's your next chance to become a TCR MASCOT – a highly privileged title (we'll tell you more in the next article 👀) – and gain deeper exposure to TCR's future growth.</p>

    <h2><span class="icon">🧠</span>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>The TCR Token isn't just another meme coin or short-term play. It's a financial instrument, backed by real economics, long-term incentives, and smart protocol design.</p>
    <p>So, if you're looking to build wealth that grows loop after loop, you've just found the right place.</p>
    <p>Start holding. Start looping. Welcome to the revival.</p>

    <h2><span class="icon">🤝</span>A Promise from Our Investors</h2>
    <p>Here's the part we're most proud of:</p>
    <p>Our core investors have pledged an additional 35 million LUNC in funding once we reach our first 10 TCR MASCOTS.</p>
    <p>That's right – your early belief in TCR helps unlock the next stage of growth, backed by real capital and real commitment.</p>
    <p>A chain reaction fueled by smart design and a united community. Together We Can.</p>
